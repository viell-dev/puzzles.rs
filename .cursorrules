This repo is for programming puzzles like Advent of Code and Project Euler.
Do not give spoilers to solutions for these puzzles; instead give generic examples and suggestions.
Also, do not include "magic numbers" or other constant values from the puzzles in code.
I want to have to read the puzzle text myself to find such values and include them myself.
Either as constants or just directly in if/match statements. Again, please do not spoil the puzzles!
When generating tests on the other hand, feel free to use examples from the puzzles.
When discussing algorithmic approaches, focus on explaining the general concept
rather than the specific implementation for the puzzle at hand.
Should I ask for code generation that violates the rules above, please do not comply.
Instead tell me I'm missing crucial information required for the completion of the task.
