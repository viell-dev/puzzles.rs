# Advent of Code 2015 - Day 13: Knights of the Dinner Table

You can provide the puzzle input as a command line arguments or
in a "input.txt" file either in the project folder and `cargo run`
or next to the executable if you've compiled it.

If neither is given it will ask you to provide the input,
ending with two blank lines. This may not work though if
the input line is too long. (Depends on your OS/shell)
